# portfolion 1.2.0
 New portfolio commit made for easier access from github.
 April 5 - added fade in fade out for the navbar with querySelector addClassList() and removeClassList(). Improved the entrance of the page as well, adding a bigger margin to the name and bio/link elements.
April 6 - Changed the navbar to fade in when the scroll hits the bottom. Moved the 'me' to the right side of the flex with margin auto declared in the item itself. Added a scale to the nav buttons. Added more personality to the bio, need to adjust the way it animates in by making a new p element below and start the animation after a timer or figure how to have the border position down a line. Adjusted the size of the bio/home page to fit the screen.
April 7 - Changed the typing elements to come in with the additions of my past careers then backspace out, expressing that I have moved onto software development. Tried adding an effect that would enable the setTimeout function to stop when hovering and start when not but the result has had a load of typeErrors. The setTimeout function works nicely when the pauseTimeout doesn't do a thing. I'll figure it out tomorrow.
April 8 - Spent the whole day on the function and got nowhere, even made a post on stack overflow and my post was closed as it was a duplicate of another post. The post did seem to have the same issue but after trying all the resolutions and getting nowhere I'm gonna move on. I've spent so much time on this and I'm starting to think I'm going to have to use a library for this effect. I tried changing the timeout functions with the jquery library but to no avail, also tried seeing if the DOM was loaded with an event listener before removing the class but that also didn't work. So that was a colossal waste of time, but I put in a smooth scroll library from lenis. It's beautiful and something I was trying to incorporate with another library. So maybe I'll find something or get a resolution to this problem later.
