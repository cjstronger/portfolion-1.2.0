# portfolion 1.2.0
 New portfolio commit made for easier access from github.
 April 5 - added fade in fade out for the navbar with querySelector addClassList() and removeClassList(). Improved the entrance of the page as well, adding a bigger margin to the name and bio/link elements.
April 6 - Changed the navbar to fade in when the scroll hits the bottom. Moved the 'me' to the right side of the flex with margin auto declared in the item itself. Added a scale to the nav buttons. Added more personality to the bio, need to adjust the way it animates in by making a new p element below and start the animation after a timer or figure how to have the border position down a line. Adjusted the size of the bio/home page to fit the screen.
